# Secret Life Of Blood Glucose

## Getting Started
1. Download the dataset from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/cgmacros/1.0.0/)
2. Unzip and rename the folder to `data`
3. Run `data_cleaning.py` to process the data

## Project Overview
This visualization project explores blood glucose patterns across different diabetic groups using the CGMacros dataset.

## Interactive Visualizations

### Understanding Diabetes
- Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting how the body processes food into energy
- It's a prevalent health issue in the United States
- Our dataset focuses on Type 2 Diabetes (Toggle between Type 1 and Type 2 information)

### Interactive User Profile
Take our quiz to identify which participant profile matches yours! We've sampled 5 participants each from non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, and diabetic groups (15 total) for focused visualization.

### Meal Frequency Analysis
Explore meal patterns across different diabetic groups:
- Hover to view caloric breakdown
- Filter by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
- Note: Regular meal timing in diabetic groups reflects medical management, not dietary preference

### Blood Glucose Dynamics
Watch glucose levels change over time:
- Compare stability patterns between groups
- Observe how non-diabetics maintain steady levels
- Notice increasing volatility in pre-diabetic and diabetic groups

### Post-Meal Response Analysis
Examining controlled breakfast and lunch responses:
- Peak glucose excursion
- Time to peak
- Recovery duration
- Statistical distribution of responses

### Custom Exploration Tool
Create your own analysis:
- Select variables
- Compare groups
- Investigate snack impacts -->
